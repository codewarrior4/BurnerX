# 🐦 Twitter Launch Posts: BurnerX

### Post 1: The "Everyday Use" Vibe
Stop giving your real email to every random site you visit. 🙄

I built BurnerX so you can generate a private email in 1 second, and it actually stays there when you hit refresh. 

Clean, dark mode, and free.

### Post 2: The Flex
Finally fixed the "disposable email" problem.

BurnerX now has:
- Desktop notifications for new mail 🔔
- QR codes to share specific emails instantly 📲
- Navy blue "security" vibe 🏛️
- Zero ads. Zero tracking.

### Post 3: The "Why I Built It"
Built a better way to stay anonymous online. 🛡️

Most temporary mail sites look like they're from 2010. BurnerX is built with Vue 3 and it's basically a full email client for your burner identities.

Survivor of browser refreshes.
