## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

GitHub Pages only serves static files, so it cannot run Vite's local `/api` proxy. For the live demo to call Mail.tm without browser CORS errors, deploy a small proxy such as the Cloudflare Worker in `examples/mailtm-proxy-worker.js`.

After deploying the worker, add its URL as a GitHub repository variable:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

Then rerun the Pages workflow. Local development continues to use Vite's `/api` proxy automatically.

## 📖 How It Works

BurnerX communicates with the [Mail.tm API](https://api.mail.tm/) through a development or production proxy. Every time you generate an account, the credentials (email and password) are stored in your browser's `localStorage`. This allows the app to fetch a JWT token and retrieve your messages even if you close the tab.

### Key Flows

1. **Identity Creation** → Calls `POST /accounts` then `POST /token` to register and authenticate
2. **Message Polling** → Calls `GET /messages` every 5 seconds with the JWT bearer token
3. **Notifications** → Compares message count on each poll; fires a native `Notification` on increase
4. **Export/Import** → Serializes identity data to JSON; import re-authenticates via `POST /token`
